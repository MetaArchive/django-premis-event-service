Development
===========

Here, you will find some information helpful if you plan on developing upon or
making changes to the Event Service source code itself.

Project Structure
-----------------

The PREMIS Event Service is structured as a common Python project, providing a
Python package named `premis_event_service` which is a Django app.

If you're not sure where to look for something, `urls.py` is usually the best
place to start.  There you'll find a list of every URL pattern handled by the
application, along with its corresponding view (found in `views.py`) and 
arguments.
